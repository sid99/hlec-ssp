- All the messages should have store name, only missing thing is delivery dates
- Seller name is visible in the BCP header
- Cancellation worklfow should work as expected, buyer will not receive cancellation message when she cancels the order(lets discuss more in call), will receive message when Seller does
- Buyer Name inputs in BCP
- checkout payment status before confimration - we do not send confirmation second time, so this should be resolved
- When fulfilled is pressed, we have to send a payment link if status is not paid
